# DeepArchitect: Automatically Designing and Training Deep Architectures

This repository contains a Python implementation of the DeepArchitect framework described in 
[our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08792). 
To get familiar with the framework, we recommend starting with 
[this tutorial](https://github.com/negrinho/deep_architect/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb).

A tar file with the logs of the experiments in the paper is available [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~negrinho/assets/papers/deep_architect/logs.tar.gz). You can download it, unzip it in the top folder of the repo, and generate the plots of the paper using `plots.py`. The logs are composed of text and pickle files. It may be informative to inspect them. The experiments reported in the paper can be reproduced using `experiments.py`.
